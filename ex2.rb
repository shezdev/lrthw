# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.
# aka  octothorpe, pound, hash

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "this won't run"

puts "this will run"

# review each line going backward.
# --------------------------------
# Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
# It's a trick to make your brain not attach meaning to each part of the code,
# and doing that makes you process each piece exactly.
# This catches errors and is a handy error-checking technique.
