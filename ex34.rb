# Exercise 34: Accessing Elements of Arrays

# # ordinal == 'ord'ered, 1st; cardinal == 'cards' at random, 0.
# Every time you say to yourself, "I want the third
# animal," you translate this "ordinal" number to a
# "cardinal" number by subtracting 1 - i.e. the element.

animals = ['bear', 'ruby', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']
